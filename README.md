------

Give your users the tools to be secure by default.

Password Pusher is an open source application to communicate sensitive information over the web. Secret links expire after a certain number of views and/or time has passed.

Hosted at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) but you can also easily run your own private instance with just a few steps.

* __Easy-to-install:__ Host your own via Docker, a cloud service or just use [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com)
* __Open Source:__ No blackbox code.  Only trusted, tested and reviewed open source code.
* __Versatile:__ Push passwords, text, files or URLs that auto-expire and self delete.
* __Audit logging:__ Track and control what you've shared and see who has viewed it.
* __Encrypted storage:__ All sensitive data is stored encrypted and deleted entirely once expired.
* __Host your own:__ Database backed or ephemeral, easily run your own instance isolated from the world.
* __Admin Dashboard:__ Manage your self-hosted instance with a built in admin dashboard.
* __Automatic TLS:__ No more messing with Nginx, Apache or SSL/TLS termination points.  Secure out of the box and ready to go.
* __Logins__: Invite your colleagues and track what is pushed and who retrieved it.
* __Unbranded delivery page:__ No logos, superfluous text or unrelated links to confuse end users.
* __Internationalized:__ 29 language translations are bundled in.  Easily selectable via UI or URL
* __JSON API:__ Raw JSON API available for 3rd party tools or command line via `curl` or `wget`.
* __Command line interface:__ Automate your password distribution with CLI tools or custom scripts.
* __Themes:__ [26 themes](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/themes/) bundled in courtesy of [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch).  Select with a simple environment variable.
* __Customizable:__ Change text and default options via environment variables.
* __Light & dark themes:__  Via CSS @media integration, the default site theme follows your local preferences.
* __Re-Brandable:__ Completely white label: customize the theme, site name, tagline and logo to fit your environment.
* __Custom CSS:__ Bundle in your own custom CSS to add your own design.
* __>10 Years Old:__ Password Pusher has securely delivered millions and millions of passwords in its 14 year history.
* __Actively Maintained:__ I happily work for the good karma of the great IT/Security community.
* __Honest Software:__  Open source written and maintained by [me](https://github.com/pglombardo) with the help of some great contributors.  No organizations, corporations or evil agendas.

# Editions

If you are considering to self-host the OSS edition, you can try it out immediately at [https://oss.pwpush.com](https://oss.pwpush.com).

In 2024, I introduced a set of **Pro features** exclusively on [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) to better support the project.

These Pro features are periodically migrated to the OSS edition.  You can read more about how this works [here](https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/editions/).

To see the differences between pwpush.com and the OSS edition take a look at the [Feature Matrix](https://pwpush.com/features#matrix).

# Self-Hosted Password Pusher Pro

 Early BETA testing of Self-Hosted Password Pusher _Pro_ has started.  These are the Pro features not available yet in the open source edition.

 üéÅ __Also by signing up, you are guaranteed a 20% discount on your first year‚Äôs Self-Hosted Pro license fee__. We will send out a coupon code to you at launch.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

## Run your own ephemeral instance

‚Üí Setup a DNS record to point to your server (e.g. `pwpush.example.com`) and run:

```

and browse to `https://pwpush.example.com`.
