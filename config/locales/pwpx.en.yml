      about_4: Password Pusher is a simple and convenient solution for securely sharing passwords without the need for email or other less secure communication methods.
      about_5: Hosted at %{pwpush_link} or you can run your own private instance wherever you like.

      age_title: More Than %{years_count} Years Old

      intro_4: 'There are four different flavors of Password Pusher to suit your needs: <strong>Open Source</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong>, <strong>Pro</strong>, and <strong>Self-Hosted</strong>.'
      intro_5: Below is a feature matrix that outlines the key features of each flavor.
      title: Features
    generate_key:
      env_var: You can apply this key to your application by setting the environment variable
      explanation: Explanation
      generate_key: Generate Encryption Key
      generated: Generated Encryption Key
      intro: This page is used as a helper tool to generate a random encryption key for self-hosted instances of Password Pusher.
      intro_2: Password Pusher encrypts sensitive data in the database.  Although there is a default key included, it's best practice to use your own custom encryption key.
      intro_3: With each refresh, this page generates a new encryption key.  You can use the randomly generated code below to configure your Password Pusher instance.
      note_1: If an encryption key isn't provided, a default key will be used.
      note_2: The best security for private instances of Password Pusher is to use your own custom encryption key although it is not required.
      note_3: The risk in using the default key is lessened if you keep your instance secure and your push expirations short.  e.g.  1 day/1 view versus 100 days/100 views.
      note_4: Once a push expires, all encrypted data in that push is deleted.
      note_5: Changing an encryption key where old pushes already exist will make those older pushes unreadable.  In other words, the payloads will be garbled.  New pushes going forward will work fine.
      note_6: 'Key generation can also be done from the command line in the application source by executing:'
      notes: 'Notes:'
      reload: Reload this page to re-generate a new key.
