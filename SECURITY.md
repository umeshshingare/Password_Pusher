# Security Policy

This page outlines the general procedure for reporting security vulnerabilities.

All reports (and the time you spend to discover them) are very much appreciated.

With the community, I hope to keep Password Pusher up to date with the latest developments and best security practices.

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to [contact me](https://pwpush.com/feedbacks/new) anytime!

## Supported Versions

I encourange the safe reporting of security issues for the latest minor
version of the software.  e.g. `v1.47.x` as of November 2024.

This is a general rule but I would be open to hear any and all security reports that you feel are necessary.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the Github [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/security/advisories/new) feature.

_I kindly ask you to not report any potential vulnerabilies publicly as it may put existing users at risk.  Your help in this is greatly appreciated!_
